### ACT and SAT Anaylsis in California 

In recent years there has been increased focus on the unequal state of higher education in the United States. The vast majority of those admitted to top universities come from wealthy backgrounds. This is in part due to inequality in standardized test scores. Wealthy students have more resources for tutors and supplies to study and therefore have had higher scores. As a result, many colleges have switched from requiring test scores to test optional. In March of 2021 the University of California system switched to test optional as the result of a lawsuit. Nevertheless standardized testing remains popular  in California alone over 1.5 million SAT tests and over 330000 were administered and remain an important part of the college application process. 

The purpose of this project is the analyze data from the California school districts and answer two questions: 

-1: On a district and school level, is there significant inequality in the California Public School System?     

-2: When looking at district data and levels of poverty, is there any correlation between standardized testing and school district poverty levels?

For the SAT I found that there is a pretty large range of values between school districts. The data did not provide raw SAT scores but instead the percentage of students who reached a benchmark goal set by the College Board who runs the SAT. The benchmark score for the 2018-2019 year were 460 in reading and writing and 510 in math. Whitney (Gretchen) High School in LA country had the highest average score in California at 98.9 percent. Los Angeles Unified, the largest school district in the state, had an average pass rate of 20.7 percent. The average pass rate for the entire state was 46.5 percent.

For the ACT the data set included both raw scores and percent of students who passed the benchmark score of 21.  The raw score followed a fairly normal distribution with a consensus around the medium score of 22. Lynbrook High School  in Santa Clara County had the highest average ACT score at 32. Citrus High School in San Bernardino County had the lowest average score of 12. In looking at the pass rate, the ACT had a slightly higher pass rate than the SAT at 52.6 percent. Los Angeles Unified had a pass rate of 29.3 percent. 

Poverty is a deeply complicated issue and how it affects test scores is beyond the scope of this project. On average 16 percent of high school age children are poor in California which has the highest poverty rate in the country.  When compared with test scores by school district it shows a slight negative correlation between the amount of poverty and test scores. Raw ACT scores shows the greatest correlation with a -0.612. This is followed by the average ACT scores over 21 at -0.609. The lowest correlation was the percent of students passing the SAT. Overall there does appear to be at least some correlation between poverty in school district and test scores.
